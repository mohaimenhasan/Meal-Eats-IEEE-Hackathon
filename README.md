# Meal-Eats-IEEE-Hackathon
Hackathon project. Works with a remote client and Qualcomm dragonboard 410c as a server with an arduino shield. Receives a destination from the client. Takes the source from the GPS of dragonboard and creates a route using Google maps API. After parsing, the route is serialized and it is sent as a trans-receiving signal on the arduino board on top of the controlled bot.

# Components

 - Google Maps API
 - Qualcomm Dragonboard 410c
 - Arduino
